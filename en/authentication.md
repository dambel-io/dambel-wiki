## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Email address is already in use"**
- This means someone has already registered with this email
- Try signing in instead, or use a different email address

**"Username can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores"**
- Make sure your username doesn't have spaces or special characters
- Use only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and underscores (_)

**"Passwords do not match"**
- Make sure both password fields have exactly the same text
- Check for any extra spaces or typos

**"Password must be at least 6 characters long"**
- Your password needs to be at least 6 characters
- Consider using a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols for better security

### Network Issues

If you're having trouble connecting:

1. Check your internet connection
2. Make sure you're not on a restricted network
3. Try again in a few moments
4. If problems persist, contact support
